# Transfer-Learning-Crop-Disease

This repo contains the code and supporting documents I created for my final project in a graduate class on advanced machine learning. This program tested the effectiveness of transfer learning methods to improve the performance of a plant disease classification model. For more information on my motivation for this project and the details of its construction, read the project report included in this repo.
